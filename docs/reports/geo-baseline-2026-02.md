### 3. "кухня на заказ таллинн" (Custom Kitchen Tallinn, Russian)
**Position:** 8th
**URLs Ranking:**

- English pages appearing in Russian search results indicate content mismatch
- Lost opportunity: Russian-speaking population in Estonia + international Russian market
- ~25-30% of Estonia's population speaks Russian as primary language

**Recommendation:**
**URGENT** - Implement Russian language localization:
- Create `/ru/` section with Russian translations
- Use TranslatePress plugin (already in use) to create proper /ru/ versions
- Optimize Russian pages for Cyrillic keyword variants
- Add Russian schema markup (hreflang tags)
- Focus on high-commercial-intent pages first: product pages, pricing, contact

### 6. "blum furnituur köök" (Blum Hardware/Fittings - Supplier Query)
**Position:** 9th
**URL Ranking:** `studiokook.ee/ladustamissusteemid/` (Storage Systems page)
**Query Intent:** Supplier/specification-focused (B2B or technical)
**Status:** ⚠ Visible but weak

**Top Competitors:**
1. **Blum.com/ee** - Official Blum site (1st position)
2. **Tähe Mööblifurnituur** - Direct hardware supplier
3. **Mööblifurnituur AS** - Hardware distributor

- Studiokook ranks 9th, appearing in non-commercial position
- Competitors are hardware distributors and official Blum channels
- Studiokook's mention is as an application/user of Blum products (legitimate but weak)
- This is likely not high-priority commercial query for furniture makers
- Suggests Blum products are standard offering (good for credibility, but not unique positioning)

**Recommendation:** Low priority. This query is hardware-supplier focused, not customer-acquisition focused. Current positioning is sufficient as it indicates Blum product usage.

### 7. "eritellimusköök hind eesti" (Custom Kitchen Price - Estonia)
**Position:** Not visible
**URL Ranking:** None in top 10
**Query Intent:** **HIGHEST commercial intent** (price-shopping)

2. **Mööbel ja Kodu** - Custom furniture pricing
3. **Sisustuskeskus.ee** - General pricing discussion
4. **Ekspress Mööbel** - Custom furniture pricing

7. **Furnum.ee** - Price discussion
8. **Agrees.ee** - Material/price relationship

**Analysis:**
- **Critical Gap:** Studiokook is completely invisible for price-focused searches
- This is the HIGHEST commercial intent query (users ready to buy, evaluating costs)
- Competitors like Ananke and Holzmaier explicitly mention pricing
- Holzmaier has dedicated "Hinnaklassid" (price classes) page (direct conversion focus)
- Users searching "hind" (price) are in decision stage - ready to convert
- Studiokook lacks transparent pricing information on website (likely, based on not ranking)
- Missing this query represents lost qualified leads

**Recommendation:**
**HIGH PRIORITY** - Implement transparent pricing strategy:
- Create dedicated "Pricing" or "Hinnad" page in Estonian
- Develop price range guides (budget, mid-range, premium)
- Add cost breakdowns (materials, labor, installation)
- Create pricing comparison content vs. competitors
- Implement local schema (priceRange property in business schema)
- Add FAQ content addressing "kuidas makstakse?" (how much does it cost?)

## Search Engine Behavior Observations

### Google's Ranking Factors for This Vertical

1. **Domain Authority/Age:** Older established companies (Ananke 20+ years, Mööbel ja Kodu 25+ years) rank consistently higher
2. **Language Localization:** Multi-language sites (KöögiART, VENDI with dedicated language versions) outrank single-language for region-specific searches
3. **Transparent Pricing:** Sites with explicit pricing information (Holzmaier, Ananke) rank for price queries; Studiokook's lack of pricing causes invisibility
4. **Content Investment:** Educational content (materials, guides) correlates with ranking positions
5. **Local Signals:** Business registry listings, Google Maps, schema markup for local businesses
6. **Portfolio/Case Studies:** DSK Furniture's case study content drives visibility

## Monitoring Metrics

Track these KPIs monthly:

| Metric | Current | Target (3 months) |
|--------|---------|-------------------|
| "eritellimusköök tallinn" position | 2nd | 1st |
| "eritellimusköök hind eesti" visibility | 0 (absent) | Top 5 |

## Conclusion

Studiokook demonstrates strong positioning in English-language and educational queries, but has significant gaps in commercial-intent queries (pricing), language localization (Russian), and portfolio content (case studies). The implementation of Russian language support and transparent pricing strategy will address the two largest opportunities for GEO improvement. With systematic execution of these recommendations, Studiokook can improve its GEO score from 6.5/10 to 8.5+/10 within three months, capturing qualified leads currently going to competitors like Ananke, Holzmaier, and KöögiART.

**Primary Recommendation:** Begin with Russian language implementation and pricing strategy immediately, as these address the lowest-hanging fruit with highest commercial impact.
