Credentials Migration Log
Task: Security Audit 2026-02-10 - Task 1: Secure Credentials
Date: 2026-02-11

Migration Notes:
- .credentials.json contains OAuth tokens managed by Claude Code
- File is auto-regenerated on login by Claude Desktop
- No manual migration required - credentials are system-managed

Security Status: VERIFIED
- .gitignore already contains .credentials.json (line 18)
- Credentials are excluded from git tracking
- No changes required to .gitignore

Conclusion: No user action needed. Credentials are properly secured.
